# Global Game Jam 2017

This is a working repository for one Global Game Jam team based in Stockholm, Sweden. Prior to the jam, this was used to create a code base of things we're likely to use, like sprite loading. Then from 17:00 on 20 January 2017, we receive the theme and jamming begins. We won't reveal the theme of the jam until all timezones have started.

We're using LÖVE, an awesome 2D game-making framework.
